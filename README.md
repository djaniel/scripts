# Scripts

A collection of scripts to set up my Linux workspace. Practicality.
Because they are hard to maintain and tune, they are not shortcuts, they are a guide. They were tested in Pop OS. The name of the scripts gives a hint of what is is installing.

- **setup.sh** Basic tools to work and to program 
- **docker.sh**
- **firejail.sh**
- **apptainer.sh**
- **nvim chand**
