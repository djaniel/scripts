# Scripts

A collection of scripts to remind myself how to set up some tools.

They are not shortcuts, they are a guide. The name of the scripts gives a hint of what is is installing.

- **setup.sh** Basic tools to work and to program 
- **docker.sh**
- **firejail.sh**
- **apptainer.sh**
- **nvim chand**
